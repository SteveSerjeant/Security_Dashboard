# Security_Dashboard

This will be the repository for my COMP3000 project. The project will aim to provide a security dashboard for home computer users at all levels that will provide information about the home network. this will include internal IP addresses, MAC addresses, operating system details and possibly details of vulnerabilities affecting the network with how-to guides to help secure the systems.
